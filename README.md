# rustdocmd
rustdocmd is a simple tool that extracts specially marked rustdoc comment regions from Rust source files and writes them as standalone Markdown files. This enables seamless, automated integration of code documentation into systems like mdBook, keeping your project docs always in sync with your codebase.
