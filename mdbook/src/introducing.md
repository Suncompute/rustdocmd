rustdocmd

With this tool, you can write comprehensive, versioned documentation directly in your Rust code using rustdoc comments (`///` or `//!`).

Specially marked sections are automatically extracted and output as standalone Markdown files.

This way, your code and comments become a complete, always up-to-date documentation that can be seamlessly and automatically integrated into systems like mdBook—ensuring your project documentation always matches the current state of your code.

The tool is still in a prototype stage and is continuously being developed.
